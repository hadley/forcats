## Overview

R uses __factors__ to handle categorical variables, variables that have a fixed and known set of possible values, and are also helpful for reordering character vectors to improve display. The goal of the __forcats__ package is to provide a suite of tools that solve common problems with factors. 

## Installation

```R
# The easiest way to get forcats is to install the whole tidyverse:
install.packages("tidyverse")

# Alternatively, install just forcats:
install.packages("forcats")

# Or the the development version from GitHub:
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("tidyverse/forcats")
```

## Getting started

forcats is part of the core tidyverse, so you can load it with `library(tidyverse)` or `library(forcats)`.

```{r setup, message = FALSE}
library(forcats)
```

Factors are used to describe categorical variables with a fixed and known set of __levels__. You can create factors with the base `factor()` or [`readr::parse_factor()`](http://readr.tidyverse.org/reference/parse_factor.html):

```{r}
x1 <- c("Dec", "Apr", "Jan", "Mar")
month_levels <- c(
  "Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun", 
  "Jul", "Aug", "Sep", "Oct", "Nov", "Dec"
)

factor(x1, month_levels)

readr::parse_factor(x1, month_levels)
```

The advantage of `parse_factor()` is that it will generate a warning if values of `x` are not valid levels:

```{r}
x2 <- c("Dec", "Apr", "Jam", "Mar")

factor(x2, month_levels)

readr::parse_factor(x2, month_levels)
```

Once you have the factor, forcats provides helpers for solving common problems. 

## Resources 

For a history of factors, I recommend [_stringsAsFactors: An unauthorized biography_](http://simplystatistics.org/2015/07/24/stringsasfactors-an-unauthorized-biography/) by Roger Peng, and [_stringsAsFactors = \<sigh\>_](http://notstatschat.tumblr.com/post/124987394001/stringsasfactors-sigh) by Thomas Lumley.  If you want to learn more about other approaches to working with factors and categorical data, I recommend [_Wrangling categorical data in R_](https://peerj.com/preprints/3163/), by Amelia McNamara and Nicholas Horton.) The R for Data Science book also has a [chapter on factors](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/factors.html).
